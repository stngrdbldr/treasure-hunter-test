<!-- # Code base for front end code test to Atlas Copco's DDS team

The code base contains two directories; one for the API (built with C#/.NET Core) and one for a react app skeleton.
These are provided to aid you in the implementation and allow to focus on the frontend.
You are completely free to modify or replace them as you see fit.
For more detail about the API and react app skeleton, see READMEs in respective directories. -->
